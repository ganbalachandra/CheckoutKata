# The LateRooms Group Node task

Please take a couple of hours at most to tackle this task. Your solution will be the basis for a discussion during our interview. 

## The Task

Please write an API using Node.JS that returns a JSON response in the following structure...

```
[{
    "id": "16296355",
    "url": "r16296355_manchester",
    "text": "Manchester"
},
{
    "id": "16844357",
    "url": "k16844357_manchester-city-centre",
    "text": "Manchester City Centre"
}]
```

The API should expose a single ```GET``` endpoint ```/{{term}}``` where term can be letters or numbers and has a minimum length of 3 characters.

The API should use the following endpoints to build the response.

Please return mappings for all the id's returned by the search endpoint.

We would like any JavaScript to be test driven (in whatever library and test framework you feel comfortable with). 

Feel free to use any npm packages you deem appropriate.
